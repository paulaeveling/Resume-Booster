<h1>Resume Booster</h1> 

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Are you looking for a job and want to get your resume noticed by employers? If the answer is yes, then this program is for you.<br><br>

Studies have shown that up to 75% of qualified applicants are rejected even before they are seen by human eyes. This happens because most companies use a software called Applicant Tracking System (ATS) to scan, sort and rank job applicants.<br>

ATS scans your resume for specific keywords to determine if your job application should be passed along to the recruiter. Unfortunately, that means if a resume is not written and formatted with the applicant tracking system in mind, a qualified candidate can be easily passed over.</p>

<b>How to write an ATS-friendly resume?</b><br>
<p>Optimize your resume with keywords. Using resume keywords should be a no-brainer, but itâ€™s sadly often overlooked and <p>could be the reason behind your resume constantly falling into a black hole.

When it comes to creating an ATS-optimized resume, you need to think about the frequency, as well as the placement of these keywords throughout your resume. Some ATSs will determine the strength of your skills based on the number of times a term shows up in your resume, whereas others assign an estimated amount of experience for a particular skill based on its placement within the resume. To make your resume truly compatible with any ATS, you'll want to optimize it with both systems in mind.

This program will help you to identify LinkedIn job posting keywords (nouns, verbs, and adjectives) so you can boost your resume and increase your chances of being noticed by employers.</p>
